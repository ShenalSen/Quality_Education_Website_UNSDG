        <p>Below are the tasks accomplished in my capacity as editor <br> for the PRIME ED Â© website.
        </p>
        <a href="Home.html">Task 1 - Home Page</a>

        <div class="para">
            <p>As the designated individual responsible for the development of the home page, <br> website template, and navigation bar, I approach this task with a commitment <br>to precision and excellence.</p>

            <p>Home Page Elements:<br>
            I diligently incorporated essential elements into the home page design, ensuring<br> a cohesive representation of our website's identity and mission. The inclusion of our logo<br> prominently establishes our brand identity, while articulating our alignment with a<br> UN Sustainable Development Goal underscores our dedication to sustainability.</p>

            <p>Navigation Bar and CSS Styling:<br>
            With meticulous attention to detail, I crafted a navigation bar that facilitates seamless navigation throughout the website. Employing CSS styling techniques, I ensured that the navigation bar not only indicates the active page but also features a visually appealing hover effect to highlight available links. This cohesive design approach fosters a user-friendly browsing experience.</p>

            <p>Links to Content:<br>
            Recognizing the importance of guiding users to relevant content, I integrated links to the four dedicated content pages within the home page layout. Whether presented as a gallery or interactive tiles, these links serve as pathways for users to explore further, enriching their engagement with our website.</p>

            <p>User-Centric Approach:<br>
            In adherence to best practices, I prioritized user experience enhancement throughout the design process. By implementing intuitive navigation elements and visually inviting hover effects, I aimed to captivate users' attention and encourage interaction with our website. Furthermore, I ensured smooth transitions between different sections, fostering a seamless browsing experience.</p>         
        </div>

        <a href="FeedBack_Form.html">Task 2 - Feedback Form</a>

        <div class="para">
            <p>Key Elements:
            I have ensured that the feedback form page incorporates essential elements to facilitate seamless interaction for users. This includes input fields for users to enter their name, email (optional or mandatory based on requirements), rating, and comment or message. Additionally, optional fields such as a subject line or category selection have been included to categorize comments effectively.</p>
            
            <p></p>Validation and Error Handling:
            To maintain data integrity and user experience, validation checks have been implemented. These checks ensure that email input follows the correct format and that all required fields are completed before submission. In cases where users attempt to submit the form with missing or invalid information, clear error messages and indications have been provided. Furthermore, fields requiring attention are highlighted to assist users in correcting their input seamlessly.</p>
            
            <p></p>Preview and Edit Options:
            To empower users and enhance their experience, the feedback form allows for previewing and editing before submission. This feature enables users to review their input and make any necessary adjustments, ensuring accuracy and completeness before finalizing their feedback.</p>
            
            <p></p>Confirmation:
            Upon successful submission of the feedback form, users are greeted with a confirmation message. This acknowledgment serves to reassure users that their feedback has been received successfully, fostering a positive user experience and instilling confidence in the feedback process.</p>
            
            <p></p>Email Functionality:
            To demonstrate the functionality during the demo, the feedback form has been set up to email the contents of the form to a valid email address. This ensures that feedback is promptly delivered to the intended recipient, facilitating efficient communication and response.</p>
